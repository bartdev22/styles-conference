                <h3>Chris Mills</h3>
                <h4>HEAVY METAL CODING</h4>
                <p>In this unconventional talk, Chris Mills will encourage you to pick up some drum sticks in addition to your laptop, and beat out a rhythm or learning - both of code and drum beats! You´ll learn basic JavaScript and CSS, plus beginner´s heavy metal drum patterns. The two are a marriage made in heaven, as nothing is a better antidote to code frustration than beating seven shades of **** out of a drum kit.</p>
